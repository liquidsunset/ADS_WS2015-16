PLEASE RENAME FIRST assignment3.3.rar TO assignment3.3.jar.
CAUSE GMAIL DOESN’T ALLOW US TO SEND DIRECTLY JAR-FILES!!! 

We provide a jar file (assignment3.3.jar) with our small test case for assignment 3.3.
Just run the assignment3.3.jar with
java -jar path-to-file/assignment3.3.jar

By providing a boolean argument to the jar call the scheduling can be defined:
java -jar path-to-file/assignment3.3.jar true
This call would set the serial schedule.
